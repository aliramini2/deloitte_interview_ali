# Gradient Boosting Model Deployment for Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project includes the deployment of a machine learning model designed to predict fraudulent transactions. The model, based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm, is served through a Flask application and deployed on Heroku for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Utilizes a robust machine learning algorithm for predictive accuracy.
- **Flask Application**: Facilitates real-time API-based predictions.
- **Heroku Deployment**: Allows the model to be accessed from anywhere.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
